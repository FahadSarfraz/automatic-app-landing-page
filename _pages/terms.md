# Terms and Conditions of Use

<br>

## 1. APPLICABILITY OF THE GTCU

The General Terms and Conditions of Use (hereinafter the “GTCU”) are proposed by SARFRAZ FAHAD (hereinafter the “Company”). The Company is the owner and publisher of the Waybum mobile App (hereinafter the “mobile App”).

The purpose of these GTCU is to define all the terms and conditions according to which the Company allows Users to use the Mobile App (hereinafter the “Users”).

They therefore apply to any use of the Mobile App. The User declares to have read and accepted these GTCU before any use of the Mobile App.

Prior to the entry into force of any new terms and conditions, the Company shall inform Users by any appropriate means of the entry into force of any new provisions. If the User does not express any objections within one (1) week, the amendments proposed by the Company shall be considered as having been accepted by the User.

Acceptance of these GTCU assumes on the part of Users that they have the necessary full legal capacity or, if not, have received permission from a legal guardian if they lack such capacity, or have received permission from their legal representative if they are minors, or hold a representation mandate if they are acting on behalf of a legal entity.

If the Company chooses not to enforce any provision of these GTCU at a given time, this cannot be interpreted as a waiver of any provision of the GTCU at a later time.

If certain stipulations of the GTCU are unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, including because of an applicable law or regulation, the Parties shall remain bound by the other stipulations of the GTCU and shall endeavour to remedy the unenforceable clauses in the same spirit in which they were entered into.

<br>

## 2. USER ACCOUNT

Before any use of the features of the Mobile App, the User must first create a personal account on the Mobile App.

When requesting the opening of a User account, the User must provide information about his/her identity as requested on the registration form. If the User provides inaccurate or obsolete registration data, the Company shall be entitled to refuse to create an account or to suspend any accepted account temporarily or permanently. In particular, the User undertakes to refrain from creating a false identity likely to mislead the Company or third parties or impersonating another person. The User undertakes to immediately update the data initially communicated in case of modifications.

The User shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of his/her Mobile App login identifiers. The User must inform the Company immediately of any unauthorised use of his/her identifiers. The Company cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from the User’s proved negligence in protecting his/her login identifiers and/or the personal information related to his/her account.

Once the User has registered on the Mobile App, he/she shall be assigned an account, materialised by a page containing a profile and a profile editing page from which he/she can manage his/her information.

<br>

## 3. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS

The User undertakes to comply with all provisions of these GTCU.

The User agrees to use the Mobile App for strictly personal use. In this regard, the User shall not:

* Use the Mobile App unlawfully, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these GTCU.
* Post content contrary to law and order and good morals (in particular, advocating for crimes against humanity, inciting racial hatred, child pornography, etc.);
* Post content not authorised by the Company,
* Publish commercial solicitations or unwanted content (“spam”) from the Mobile App,
* Post contents infringing the property rights, particularly intellectual property rights, of third parties.
* Sell, copy, reproduce, rent, lend, distribute, transfer or grant a sub-license for all or part of the contents appearing on the Mobile App, or decompile, extract, disassemble, modify, display in a form readable by the User, attempt to discover any source code, or use any software activating or including all or part of the Mobile App.
* Attempt to obtain unauthorised access to the Mobile App’s computer system or engage in any activity disrupting, decreasing the quality or interfering with the performance, or deteriorating the features of the Mobile App.
* Use the Mobile App for abusive purposes by voluntarily introducing viruses or any other malicious program and attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Mobile App.
* Infringe the Company’s intellectual property rights.
* Denigrate the Mobile App and/or the Products as well as the Company on social networks and any other means of communication.

If, for any reason, the Company believes that the User fails to comply with these GTCU, the Company may, at any time and at its sole discretion, eliminate the User’s access to the Mobile App and take all measures, including any civil and criminal legal action, against the User.
