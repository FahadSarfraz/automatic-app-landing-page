## 1.0 APPLICABILITY OF THE GTCU

The General Terms and Conditions of Use (hereinafter the “GTCU”) are proposed by SARFRAZ FAHAD (hereinafter the “Company”). The Company is the owner and publisher of the Waybum mobile App (hereinafter the “mobile App”).

The purpose of these GTCU is to define all the terms and conditions according to which the Company allows Users to use the Mobile App (hereinafter the “Users”).

They therefore apply to any use of the Mobile App. The User declares to have read and accepted these GTCU before any use of the Mobile App.

Prior to the entry into force of any new terms and conditions, the Company shall inform Users by any appropriate means of the entry into force of any new provisions. If the User does not express any objections within one (1) week, the amendments proposed by the Company shall be considered as having been accepted by the User.

Acceptance of these GTCU assumes on the part of Users that they have the necessary full legal capacity or, if not, have received permission from a legal guardian if they lack such capacity, or have received permission from their legal representative if they are minors, or hold a representation mandate if they are acting on behalf of a legal entity.

If the Company chooses not to enforce any provision of these GTCU at a given time, this cannot be interpreted as a waiver of any provision of the GTCU at a later time.

If certain stipulations of the GTCU are unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, including because of an applicable law or regulation, the Parties shall remain bound by the other stipulations of the GTCU and shall endeavour to remedy the unenforceable clauses in the same spirit in which they were entered into.

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
